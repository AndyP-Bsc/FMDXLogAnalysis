<h1>FM DX Interactive Log Analysis - Help File</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of this application is to provide an online interactive statistical analysis tool using data from my own FM DX loggings from the years 2014 and 2015</p>

<h2>FM DX</h2>
<p>FM DX is the hobby of receiving FM radio station well beyond their intended geographical target area by harnessing different types of radio propagation events</p>

<h2>Using the Application</h2>
<p>There are 3 simple controls:</p>
<ol>
	<li><b>Year</b>: Select All Years, 2014 or 2015 specific logbook data</li>
	<li><b>Month</b>: Select All Months or a Specific Month of logbook data</li>
	<li><b>Signal Propagation Mode</b>: Select All radio propagation enhancement modes or a specific mode to analyse</li>
</ol>

<p>These controls then effect the bar plot on the right which illustrates the total number of FM DX logs made over the Months or Days</p>
<p>Below the bar plot are calculations that show the minimum, maximum and average distance (in miles) between the radio receiver and transmitter</p>

<h2>What are propagation modes?</h2>
<p>For those not familiar with the different types of radio propagation:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Aurora</b>: The solar wind (from the Sun) hitting the Earth's atmosphere ionises the aurora curtain 'sometimes' causing radio signals to be reflected beyond their target area</li>
	<li><b>Meteor Scatter</b>: This is where meteor's burning up in the atmosphere leave a trail of ionised particles which reflect radio signal's beyond their target area</li>
	<li><b>Sporadic E</b>: Sporadic E refers to the sporadic nature of this type of radio propagation. E refers to the E layer of the atmosphere which reflects signals well beyond their target area</li>
	<li><b>Tropospheric</b>: This is where radio signals follow a duct between warm and cold air extending the normal radio range</li>
</ul>
